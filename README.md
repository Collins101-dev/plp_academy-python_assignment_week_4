# File Read and Write Program

This Python program allows users to read the contents of a file, modify the content by adding line numbers, and write the modified content to a new file. It is designed to handle common file-related errors gracefully, such as missing files or permission issues.

## Features

- Reads content from a user-specified input file.
- Adds line numbers to each line of the file content.
- Writes the modified content to a user-specified output file.
- Handles errors such as:
  - File not found.
  - Permission denied.
  - Empty filenames.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the script `file_read_write.py`.
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
3. Create or use an existing text file (e.g., `input.txt`) with sample content.
4. Run the program using the following command:
   ```bash
   python3 file_read_write.py
